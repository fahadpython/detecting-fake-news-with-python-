# detecting-fake-news-with-python-


## Project Description
This project aims to build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE. The project uses a reviews dataset and implements a TfidfVectorizer on the dataset. Then, it initializes a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fits the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well the model fares. The final accuracy score of the model is **99.74%** .
